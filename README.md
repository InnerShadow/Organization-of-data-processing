## 1. [**Lab1**](/Lab1/) task: As of today, cardiovascular diseases stand as one of the primary causes of mortality globally. Your task involves processing a collected dataset comprising risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, followed by the development of a binary classification algorithm to determine whether an individual has the condition. Use SVM & Decision tree.
## 2. [**Lab2**](/Lab2/) task: Email spam not only wastes users' time but also poses additional threats, such as phishing, extortion through false information, distribution of viral and trojan programs, etc. Your task is to develop a classifier that can distinguish spam emails based on message data analysis. The dataset includes emails labeled as either containing or not containing spam. Use Logistic regression & neural network with LSTM layer.
